# Inventory-Program
An inventory management program utilizing a dictionary

The user can use from one of the options from the menu

      1. Show all items
      2. Look up at the inventory
      3. Add an item to the inventory
      4. Change an item
      5. Delete an item
      6. Find items given category
      7. Item count, average price by category
      8. Most expensive item by category
      9. Total price by item
      10. Quit the program
      
The program was done using functions, and dictionaries.
I made it as user proof as I possibly could and instead of using If statements
for the menu I decided to use a dictionary.
